#Binary Search Tree

A simple binary tree data structure built from some arbitrary input. It includes:

* A method `#breadth_first_search` which takes a target value and returns the node at which it is located using the breadth first search technique.
* A method `#depth_first_search` which returns the node at which the target value is located using the depth first search technique.
* A method `#dfs_rec` which runs a depth first search which, instead of using a stack, searches using recursion.
